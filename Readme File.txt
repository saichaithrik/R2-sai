Readme File:
I have created four components:
1.App.js
2.Table.js
3.Row.js and 4.InputField.js 

App.js will handle the components and render the table

The table.js component will render the table structure

The Row.js handle the input field and buttons for updating values.

The InputField.js will handle the input changes

and basic CSS styling is done in App.CSS

All the components are kept in components folder 

npm install
npm start
